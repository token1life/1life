        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The 1LIFE token is a meme coin designed to facilitate the collection of donations for its creator. It operates on three networks: MATIC, BNB, and TON.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document introduces the 1LIFE token, outlining its purpose and underlying technology. The 1LIFE token, categorized as a meme coin within the cryptocurrency sphere, has gained popularity for its humorous or entertaining nature. Despite its light-hearted origins, the 1LIFE token serves a serious purpose: enabling the collection of donations for its creator.</p>

        <h2>The 1LIFE Token</h2>

        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The primary aim of the 1LIFE token is to act as a vehicle for collecting donations for its creator. This objective is achieved by harnessing the capabilities of blockchain technology, ensuring secure, transparent, and efficient transactions.</p>

        <h3>Tokenomics</h3>
        <p>The 1LIFE token operates on three networks: MATIC, BNB, and TON. This multi-network operation increases the accessibility and versatility of the token, allowing it to reach a wider audience and adapt to various use cases.</p>

        <p>The token issuance is 21,000,000 tokens on each network. You can buy the token on decentralized exchanges such as DeDust, 1inch, and Uniswap using limit orders at a price of $1 and above. There will be no additional token issuance.</p>

        <h3>My Motivation</h3>
        <p>For three years, I diligently built my cryptocurrency portfolio. Every dollar I earned was invested, often at the cost of personal and familial sacrifices. My portfolio grew steadily, and I was on the brink of reaching my goal of $100k during the bull run.

        <p>However, I inadvertently ventured into futures trading and lost a portion of my capital. This loss led me into a psychological trap, and in an attempt to recover the lost money, I continued trading using bigger leverage. As an inexperienced trader, I ended up losing all my investments.</p>

        <p>For a half of a year, I tried to supplement my losses with trading of my wages, only to find myself sinking deeper into financial distress. Now, I am left with a wealth of bitter experiences, substantial debts, and no inclination to trade. The despair of potentially spending another three years to regain my financial standing is overwhelming.</p>

        <p>Some might resort to alcohol, cigarettes, or drugs to cope, and others might even contemplate ending their lives. But I'm an optimist. Such thoughts never cross my mind. I believe in the goodness of the world and its people, and I hope they will help me accelerate my recovery. I still dream of transitioning from employment to creating my own projects that contribute positively to the world.</p>

        <p>To realize this dream, I am trying to raise the same amount I had before I started futures trading. You can support me by purchasing a 1LIFE token or making a direct donation. If financial assistance is not feasible, you can help by reposting one of my posts.</p>

        <p>While I am not able to promise that the donation will be returned, I am committed to ensuring that the donated amount returns back multiplies several times. When I have possibility I have a few ideas on how to reward you, such as making larger reverse transfers when possible or likely through coin drops of my future projects. Thank you for your support! I am really appreciate it!</p>

        <h3>Roadmap and checkpoints</h3>

        <h4>1.Feedback collection </h4>
        <p>The first checkpoint is collecting feedback. I will create several forms to receive your advice and ideas about which projects I can undertake. Additionally, there will be a form for providing wallet addresses if you wish to make a donation in a network I have not provided.</p>

        <h4>2. Raise $100,000 by selling 1LIFE tokens and receiving donations</h4>
        <p>The second checkpoint is to sell the first 100,000 tokens. Achieving this goal will allow me to pay off all my debts, complete my tasks at my current job, and transition away from being an employee for hire. Subsequently, I will focus entirely on further developing the 1LIFE token and subsequent blockchain technology projects.</p>

        <h4>3. LOTI project</h4>
        <p>The third checkpoint is LOTI projects. It is a code name of my next projects. I already have a specific project idea. I do not provide details, but I can say that I have the god of marketing in my partners and we already have the intention of creating ten crypto-projects. Why ten? It’s diversification. We believe that one out of ten projects will be very successful. Stay tuned for updates...</p>

        <h4>4. Expressing Gratitude to Supporters</h4>
        <p>The fourth checkpoint is to thank my first supporters. I am going to make airdrops of tokens of my next projects for my first 100,000 supporters. I will be primarily spent on thanking the users who supported me in reaching the first checkpoints. I am going to send back values several times bigger than the amount I received from first 100,000 token holders. I will make a snapshot of holders once I reach the first checkpoints or I decide earlier. The 1LIFE Tokens should be hold on the same wallet you bought first time. You will receive rewards if you have bought and continue to hold the token on the same wallet at the moment I make a snapshot to send my thank. I think I will also send gratitude to those supporters who moved the purchased tokens and those who bought tokens after the first 100,000. The first 100,000 will definitely be prioritized.</p>

        <h4>5. Listing project tokens</h4>
        <p>The fifth checkpoint is listing 1LIFE and LOTI project tokens on exchanges. Firstly we will use decentralized exchanges and then centralized exchenges.</p>

        <h4>6. Developing own blockchain</h4>
        <p>The sixth checkpoint is to create my own blockchain. This is a bit of a leap into the future. I’m not 100% sure that it will be necessary, but there is such a desire. Since there is a desire, I think it’s worth noting it here.</p>

        <h4>7. Documenting the Journey</h4>
        <p>The seventh checkpoint is to write a book about this journey. At present, I believe this story has the potential to be a great success. Writing a book about this experience, and perhaps even producing a movie, would be a fantastic endeavor.</p>

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <h3>Blockchain Networks</h3>
        <p>The 1LIFE token operates on the BNB, TON and MATIC networks. These networks were chosen for their speed, security, and low transaction fees.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The security of the 1LIFE token is ensured by the inherent properties of the blockchain technology it utilizes. All transactions are transparent and can be traced back to their origin, making fraudulent activity extremely difficult. For the MATIC and BNB networks, I used a copy of the smart contract from examples in the instructions for creating simple smart contracts. I published the source code of the smart contract in the corresponding networks. I am not a professional in smart contract development and I currently have no opportunity to hire auditors. The token in the TON network was created through the infrastructure promoted by the TON network. I recommend buying the token specifically in the TON network. In case the smart contract is hacked in any network, the transaction history is stored in the blockchain and it will always be possible to restore the list of those who bought the token before a potential hack. This may be needed for the distribution of rewards for participation in projects. So you can still use the MATIC and BNB networks if it’s more convenient.</p>

        <h3>My wallet addresses for direct donations:</h3>
        <p>You can send me donations directly to my addresses below in the corresponding network. You can send any tokens or native coins of this network:</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1LIFE token, while a meme coin in nature, serves a significant purpose. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, it provides a secure and efficient means of collecting donations for its creator. With its operation on three networks, it offers versatility and wide accessibility.</p>
        <p>Please don't view the token from the perspective of an investment. I'm not promising you anything. I want to return back bigger value than you gave me, but there's a chance that something will go wrong. Consider it only as a donation to me to support a person in a difficult financial situation.</p>
        <h2>Make One Life Happy!</h2>
