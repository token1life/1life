        <h1>1LIFE Token Whitepaper</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The 1LIFE token is a meme coin designed to facilitate the collection of donations for its creator. It operates on three networks: MATIC, BNB and TON.</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document presents the 1LIFE token, its purpose, and its underlying technology. The 1LIFE token is a meme coin, a type of cryptocurrency that has gained popularity due to its humorous or entertaining nature. Despite its light-hearted origins, the 1LIFE token serves a serious purpose: to facilitate the collection of donations for its creator.</p>

        <h2>The 1LIFE Token</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The primary purpose of the 1LIFE token is to serve as a means of collecting donations for its creator. This is achieved by leveraging the power of blockchain technology, which allows for secure, transparent, and efficient transactions.</p>

        <h3>Tokenomics</h3>
        <p>The 1LIFE token operates on three networks: MATIC, BNB and TOB. This tripple-network operation increases the accessibility and versatility of the token, allowing it to reach a wider audience and adapt to various use cases.</p>
        <p>The token issuance is 21,000,000 tokens in each network. You can buy the token on the decentralized exchanges 1inch and Uniswap using limit orders at a price of $1 and above. There will be no additional token issuance.</p>
        <p>The first checkpoint is to sell the first 100,000 tokens. Achieving this goal will allow me to stop being an employee for hire and spend all my time on the next checkpoints, i.e. further development of 1LIFE token and other blockchain technologies.</p>
        <p>The second checkpoint is to thank my first supporters. In case I recieved the amount above 100,000 I will be primarily spent on thanking the users who supported me in reaching the first checkpoint. I am going to send back three times the amount I received from first 100,000 token holders. This will happen if you have bought and continue to hold the token on the same wallet at the moment I have enough funds to send my thank.</p>
        <p>The third checkpoint is listing on centralized exchanges.</p>
        <p>The fourth checkpoint is to create my own blockchain.</p>
        <p>The fifth checkpoint is to write a book about the this story.</p>

        <h2>Technology</h2>
        <h3>Blockchain Networks</h3>
        <p>The 1LIFE token operates on the BNB, TON and MATIC networks. These networks were chosen for their speed, security, and low transaction fees.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>The security of the 1LIFE token is ensured by the inherent properties of the blockchain technology it utilizes. All transactions are transparent and can be traced back to their origin, making fraudulent activity extremely difficult.</p>

        <h3>Contract addresses</h3>
        <p>Please use only those contract addresses that are listed below:</p>
        <p>BNB: 0x5153b11e436c7FBDcc9F6468b1d549E9B4Cac89d <a target="_blank" href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x5153b11e436c7FBDcc9F6468b1d549E9B4Cac89d">View in bscscan.com</a></p>
        <p>MATIC: 0x5153b11e436c7FBDcc9F6468b1d549E9B4Cac89d <a target="_blank" href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x5153b11e436c7fbdcc9f6468b1d549e9b4cac89d">View in polygonscan.com</a></p>
        <p>TON: EQDFSi4-mrV0cHIeE8qxMt3Vs4eQLtuwzdOmsbkAYdBxYjtg <a target="_blank" href="https://tonscan.org/jetton/EQDFSi4-mrV0cHIeE8qxMt3Vs4eQLtuwzdOmsbkAYdBxYjtg">View in tonscan.org</a> </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The 1LIFE token, while a meme coin in nature, serves a significant purpose. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, it provides a secure and efficient means of collecting donations for its creator. With its operation on three networks, it offers versatility and wide accessibility.</p>
        <p>Please don't view the token from the perspective of an investment. I'm not promising you anything. There's a good chance that something will go wrong. Consider it only as a donation to me to support a person in a difficult financial situation.</p>
